// This is a new typography script that takes into account the fact that
// different sections of a page break at different points. 
// A potential solution is described at a general level inside the main function

function main() {
    console.log("Running typography.js");

    // Set event listeners for:
    //  - Load page
    //  - Change page width

    // You should create an object that has all the elements that change their typography
    // You should have:
    //  - The typography for each version
    //  - The width point at which they change their "typography"

    // Every time an event listener is triggered, you should iterate over the list of elements
    // and, given their specific breakpoints, apply the right typography

    // You could improve this by only changing the typography when there is no previous typography
    // or when the element's version changes
